# Toaster

The toaster appender will send the "message" key of the "extraInfo" struct to a popup in the system tray. This is helpful when the user is in front of the monitor and for essential and timely announcements.&#x20;

Note: Obviously this is NOT a good fit for automated or remote testing or for too frequent informational logging.&#x20;
